# Exploratory Data Analysis using Power BI - Retail

This repository contains the Power BI project files for a task during my Data Science and Business Analytics [internship at The Sparks Foundation (TSF)](https://internship.thesparksfoundation.info/). The task involved conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a provided retail dataset [SampleSuperstore.csv](https://github.com/fardiiin/TSF-EDA-Retail-Power-BI/blob/main/SampleSuperstore.csv), simulating the role of a business manager. The primary objective was to identify areas of improvement to enhance profitability.
